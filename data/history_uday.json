        "text": "Impact of Code Reviews on Software Code Quality Hari Uday Kiran November 23, 2025 1 Introduction In the rapidly evolving field of software engineering, ensuring high code quality is essential for building reliable, maintainable, and long-lasting software systems. Much like how 1990s pop icons such as Madonna continually refined their sound to stay relevant, software teams must continuously refine their code to keep systems healthy and adaptable. Among the various practices used to safeguard software quality, code reviews have emerged as one of the most influentialandeffectivetechniques. Codereviewssupportcollaborationandadherencetocoding standards,buttheirstrongestinfluenceliesinreducingdefectsearlyinthedevelopmentlifecycle, thereby preventing costly rework and improving long-term software quality. This report examines the impact of code reviews on software quality through insights gathered from five research papers that explore different aspects of code review, technical debt, and code smells. The first paper, by Han et al., investigates how code reviews help developers detect and discuss code smells that may evolve into defects if left unresolved [1]. Fu et al. examine how potential technical debt is revealed and addressed during review discussions, emphasizing defect-prone areas of the code [2]. Han et al. further provide empirical evidence on how re- view processes highlight structural problems associated with fault-proneness [3]. Moulla et al. broadentheperspectivebyanalyzinghowtechnicaldebtcontributestosoftwaredegradationand defect introduction over time [4]. Finally, Tornhill and Borg connect poor code quality—often originating from insufficient review practices—with quantifiable defect-related business costs [5]. Together, these papersprovide amulti-dimensionalunderstanding ofhowcodereviewsinfluence software quality. While collaboration, maintainability, and knowledge transfer are valuable outcomes, the strongest and most consistently demonstrated benefit ac"

Around 81% of identified PTD instances are resolved before merging, often within a week, demonstrating that code reviews serve as an effective mechanism for early remediation of design and implementation problems. However, approximately 19% of PTD remains unresolved, suggesting limits to reviewer capacity, prioritization, or developer workload. Limitations Thestudyisconstrainedtotwoopen-sourceecosystems,whichmayreducegeneralizability. PTD identification depends on manual analysis of natural-language review comments, introducing subjective bias. Paper 3: Code Smells Detection via Modern Code Review [3] Problem Domain and Scope This paper explores how modern code review processes contribute to the identification and mitigation of code smells in large collaborative software projects across the OpenStack and Qt communities. Objectives The primary objectives are to: Determine how frequently code smells are identified through review discussions,classify the types of smells detected,Analyze how reviewers phrase or describe these issues; and Evaluate the degree to which developers act on such feedback. Main Findings The study finds that code smells are detected at a meaningful rate in review comments, even though developers rarely use formal smell terminology. Reviewers tend to express concerns indirectly, referring to readability, complexity, or unclear responsibilities. Smells related to large classes and long methods are among the most frequently identified. A substantial portion of smell-relatedcommentsleadstocodechanges,demonstratingthatmoderncodereviewfunctions as an informal but effective mechanism for maintaining structural code quality. Limitations The results are drawn from only two large open-source communities, which may not reflect practices i"

This section presents concise summaries of the problem domain, objectives, main findings, and limitations of each paper. Paper 1: Understanding Code Smell Detection via Code Review [1] Problem Domain and Scope This paper investigates how code smells structural weaknesses in code that often lead to main- tainability problems are identified, discussed, and acted upon during modern code reviews in large open-source projects. Objectives Thepaperaimsto: Analyzehowoftencodesmellsaredetectedinreviewdiscussions, Categorize the types of code smells identified,Examine how reviewers frame feedback about code smells; and Understand whether developers respond to these comments by improving the code. Main Findings The study reveals that code smell detection is a natural outcome of review discussions, even when developers do not explicitly aim to identify smells. Smells related to complexity, naming, and poor modularity are frequently recognized. Reviewers typically describe smells in terms of clarity, readability, or maintainability rather than using formal smell terminology. Importantly, a significant portion of smell-related comments leads to code changes, indicating that the review process indirectly mitigates design issues before they evolve into defects. Limitations Theanalysisislimitedtoasmallnumberoflargeopen-sourcesystems, whichmaynotgeneralize to smaller teams or industrial environments. Smell identification relies on the interpretation of textual review comments, which introduces subjectivity.

        "text": "4 Comprehensive Analysis of Key Findings Like Whitney Houston’s 1990s ballads that layered multiple themes into a single powerful track, the five papers combine empirical evidence and conceptual insight to build a rich picture of how code reviews, technical debt, and code smells affect software quality. This section analyzes the key findings of each study and compares them across the selected literature. Paper 1 The first paper demonstrates that code reviews naturally serve as a mechanism for identifying code smells, even when reviewers do not explicitly refer to formal smell terminology [1]. Re- viewers often highlight issues related to readability, complexity, naming, and modularity, all of which connect to maintainability and defect prevention. A key finding is that reviewers frame smell-related concerns in practical terms, making them accessible and actionable. A substantial percentage of these comments lead to code improvements before merging, showing that modern code review acts as an informal but effective preventive quality control process. Paper 2 Fu et al. find that code reviews frequently uncover potential technical debt, with around 8% of review comments containing references to design flaws, documentation gaps, insufficient testing, or code-level issues [2]. Developers resolve approximately 81% of PTD instances before code is merged, highlighting code review as a powerful intervention point. The remaining unresolved debt indicates that time pressure, prioritization, or reviewer capacity can limit complete re- mediation. The study reinforces that addressing PTD early reduces future costs and defect propagation. Paper 3 Han et al. identify that code smells, particularly large classes, long methods, and scattered responsibilities, are frequently detected in review discussions [3]. Although reviewers seldom use termslike“codesmell”, theyarticulateconcernsalignedwithestablishedsmelldefinitions. Many of these comments lead to concrete changes, demonstrating t"
